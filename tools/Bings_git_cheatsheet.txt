git init - to initialize a git repo in the folder called master (main branch)
git status - check the status of the repo

Commit Method 1:
git add - stage a file to commit
git commit - opens a vim
	i - insert mode (for typing commit message)
	esc - escape insert mode
	:wq - execute the commit (check again with git status after this step)

Commit Method 2:
git add
git commit -m 'commit message here'

git log - provides the time log of the repo
git log --reverse - reverse the time order of the log
press q to exit

git add . - staging all the files in the repo for commit
git add *.html - staging only .html files

touch - bash command that adds a file to the repo {e.g. touch style.css}
touch .gitignore - creates a .gitignore file in the repo. Adding extensions like {*.log} to the file will let git ignore the extension files with {git add .}

git branch MyBranch - add a branch to the repo called MyBranch (vs master)
git checkout MyBranch - switch working branch to MyBranch
git checkout -b MyBranch - create a new branch called MyBranch and switch to it
(in master) git merge MyBranch - merge MyBranch to master
	a file created in MyBranch can be seen in master and can be added and committed in master (won't show in MyBranch log)
	a file created in MyBranch should be added and committed to MyBranch first before merging in master
	a file created in master cannot be seen in MyBranch (files created outside of MyBranch cannot be seen in MyBranch)
	a file created in MyBranch can be seen in master
	a file created/modified in MyBranch but not committed yet to MyBranch will show up ad untracked file in master

(need to confirm this), while in MyBranch use git merge master will not overwrite new edits in the MyBranch file with master file without edits

git commit -a -m 'commit message here' - allows you to skip the add part for commit (for edited existing files only, new files still needs to use add first)

During a merge conflict (with master) while in MyBranch, the branch name will be shown as (MyBranch|MERGING)
Must go into the code to fix it (difference will be marked automatically), like the following
	<<<<<<< HEAD
	change in branch
	=======
	stuff in master
	>>>>>>> master
The top part above ======= is content in MyBranch file, below ======= is the content from master file.
Once done, commit with git commit -a -m 'merge message', check status

git mergetool - Can also download and use merge tool to help with merge conflicts

git rm file.txt - deletes file.txt (the deletion still needs to be committed to take effect, good time for regrets)
git rm --cached file.txt - only removes it from the repo file system (master and child branches). The file is not deleted.
	You can add the file back to the repo file system (master and child) with git add

git stash - stash away the modifications (so it won't show on status)
git stash show - show what is being stashed
git stash apply - retrieve the stashed files
git stash clear - BE CAREFUL! This clear out the modifications

git rebase aBranch - while in bBranch, merge changes commited in aBranch into bBranch

git remote - checks what remote repo you are working with
git remote -v - shows url of the remote repo (if any)
git clone {clone url} - clones the git repo from github/remote location
