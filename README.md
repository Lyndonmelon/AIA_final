## Concept
Trash is one of the most important issues we must solve within this generation. With the help of AI, we would like to achieve efficient trash-sorting right at the user end and turn trash into gold.

We want to create a real-time computer vision system to detect a recyclable held by an approaching user and grants the user access to the corresponding recycling bin.
